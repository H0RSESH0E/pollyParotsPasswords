## Description
It was a challenging week!  Getting visual feedback from the browser when working on HTML and CSS was easy, intuitive, and required no new skills.  Learning the syntax of JavaScript while practicing the implementation of logic with that syntax while also placing console.logs and debuggers appropriately to test that logic and syntax was quite a few more moving parts.  

The following is a short description of my experience completing the project:

- It felt like a major accomplishment to see the javascript make changes to the HTML.
- I saw again that there are many ways to implement a solution as I worked through the validation of the user inputs.
- I recognized that the solutions I found on the web also came in many varieties.
- I discovered that some of the web sites which seem to offer authoritative answers really aren't to be trusted.  I decided to get in touch with the pros at Ask BCS on slack.  What an amazing resource!
- Still hard to gauge the difference between pasionate and rewarding engagement with the work and spending too long on the assignment...  :)

## Credits
This is my third project in the Coding Boot Camp provided by [The School of Continuing Studies, University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/) and [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/).  Although this project has the least visual punch of all the projects so far, it has left me with the feeling that my capacity as a web developer has increased enormously.  Not only that, but I have begun to more fully enlist the help of my tutor who has already made a huge difference in the experience.

## Features
I am continuing to practice creation of SVG images.  This time I used a filtering technique to generate an SVG from a photograph.
